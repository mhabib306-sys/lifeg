# UI & Mobile Standards

## Design Principles
- Things 3–inspired visual language (lightweight, precise spacing).
- Tap targets >= 44px height where possible.
- Clean hierarchy: title > metadata, minimal visual noise.

## Mobile Layout
- Bottom nav always visible with labels.
- Compact header on mobile with version badge.
- Task rows are tightly spaced for high density.

## Task Row Layout
- Title is single-line on mobile (ellipsis if long).
- Metadata is a single, truncated line.
- Checkbox aligned to title center when metadata is absent.

## Today Flag
- Today is a separate flag (not a status).
- Tasks can be Today and still appear in Anytime.

## Widgets
Home widgets are single-column on phones for readability.

## Calendar
- Calendar grid uses fixed row heights so empty days match filled days.
- Task lines show in minimal text with per-line due/start tag.
